# Pig-game

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds

2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score BUT if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it’s the next player’s turn.

3. The player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his ROUND score gets added to his/her GLOBAL score. After that, it’s the next player’s turn

4. The first player to reach 100 points on his/her GLOBAL score wins the game.
